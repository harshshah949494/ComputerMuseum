				The first generation of Vaio laptop computers was released in 1997 and the US$2,000 PCG-505 model was designed to be “SuperSlim,” and was housed in a four-panel magnesium body.

Sony Vaio's latest designs were released during a period of low PC sales and included models with innovations such as magnetized stands and the Vaio Tap, which was designed with a completely separate keyboard. The latest models were complemented by the Windows 8 operating system.

On February 4, 2014, Sony announced that it will sell its Vaio PC business due to poor sales and Japanese company Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) will purchase the Vaio brand, with the deal finalized by the end of March 2014. However, in a news release on the Sony Global website, published on February 5, the corporations states: "Sony continues to address various options for the PC business, but Sony has no further comments." On February 6, 2014, Sony signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with JIP for the sale of its Vaio PC business.Sony Corp. has expanded its use of the Vaio brand, which can now be found on notebooks, subnotebooks, desktops and media centres. Network media solutions by Sony will also carry the Vaio brand.

Vaio notebooks are currently shipped with Microsoft Windows 8 or with Windows 8 Pro

In mid-2005 a hidden partition on the hard drive, accessible at boot via the BIOS or within Windows via a utility is used instead of recovery media for many Vaio laptops. Pressing [F10] at the Vaio logo during boot-up will cause the notebook to boot from the recovery partition; where the user has the choice of either running hardware diagnostics without affecting the installed system, or restoring (re-imaging) the hard drive to factory condition – an option that destroys all user installed applications and data). When first running a Vaio system out of the box, users are prompted to create a set of recovery DVDs, which will be required in case of hard disk failure and replacement with a new drive. In cases where the system comes with Windows 7 64 bit pre-installed, the provided recovery media restores the system to Windows 7 32 or 64 bit. Therefore, the user must create their own recovery disks.
